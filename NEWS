                CHANGES in `bst' VERSION 0.3-3 (09-12-2013)
  o  function name mhinge was changed to mhingeova (multi-class hinge one-vs-all)
  o  function name msvm was changed to mhingebst (multi-class hinge boosting)
                
                CHANGES in `bst' VERSION 0.3-4 (05-8-2014)
  o  change output name fraction to mstop in cv.bst

                CHANGES in `bst' VERSION 0.3-5 (07-14-2014)
  o  for non-numeric responses in mada, they are now forced to be numeric
  o  fixed bugs in mada when xte and yte are missing
  o  in DESCRIPTION, change Imports: gbm to Depends: gbm, the results can be different for mada

                CHANGES in `bst' VERSION 0.3-6 (12-23-2014)
  o  intercept estimated
  o  hingeloss and hingengra were modified, they are for family="hinge" since version 0.3-11. Before version 0.3-6, they are for family="hinge2".
  o  function rbst added: boosting plus difference of convex algorithm with truncated loss functions

                CHANGES in `bst' VERSION 0.3-7 (03-14-2015)
  o  add intercept estimate for family=gaussian and center=FALSE

                CHANGES in `bst' VERSION 0.3-8 (04-06-2015)
  o  add family="expo" in bst function and rfamily="texpo" in rbst function for exponential loss and truncated exponential loss, respectively
  o  terminate boosting and robust boosting if loss value inreases

                CHANGES in `bst' VERSION 0.3-9 (06-19-2015)
  o  add robust multi-class boosting rmbst.R

                CHANGES in `bst' VERSION 0.3-10 (08-13-2015)
  o  change the algorithm with respect to base class in mbst.R
  o  change bst function with twinboost=TRUE for learner="ls". In the previous versions, bst implemented the General Twin L2Boosting with general weak learner (Alg 1), rathter than Twin L2Boosting with componentwise linear least squares (Alg 2), cf: Buhlmann and Hothorn (2010). However, as Proposition 2 demonstrates, Alg 1 is not equal to Alg2 unless underlying regression model is orthonormal. The change is to match Alg 1. 

                CHANGES in `bst' VERSION 0.3-11 (12-07-2015)
  o  add parallel computing for cross-validation in cv.bst function
  o  add twintype argument for learner="ls" and twinboost=TRUE. If twintype=2, it does the same before and excluding version 0.3-10. If twintype=1, it does the same as version 0.3-10 
  o  change argument "type" in bst and related functions to "threshold"
  o  add vignette file
  o  in function bst, boosting was terminated early if the fitted loss function value increased. This was changed and boosting only terminates for those loss functions related to truncated loss functions
  o  add inst/extdata and two vignettes 

                CHANGES in `bst' VERSION 0.3-12 (12-23-2015)
  o  add a data analysis example to khan.Rnw
  o  add a new vignette mcl.Rnw
  o  modify ex1data function
  o  fix a bug in predict.mbst when newdata=NULL and newy=NULL
